# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [EVERYONE Needs to Learn a Little Bit of AWK!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ02kEETw70)<br>
Pretty simple and short crash course on AWK, although not a complete tutorial, but the presentation of what is available and the most important basic features are covered. Kinda surprised that awk is actually classified as a programming language, after finding out much more turns out it can do alot of things as a programming language would such as arithmetics. AWK uses `$0`, `$1`, and `$2` etc. to identify which part of each line you want to get, for the whole line it's `$0` while first and second word only it's `$1`, `$2`, and so on.

2. [Vim Diesel's OFFICIAL Vimtutor Let's Play/Commentary! (1 HOUR+ Special)](https://youtu.be/d8XtNXutVto)<br>
Tutorial about VIM brought in a fun way with memes and referrences to other popular stuff. The creator of the video also provides some common best practices and also "life hacks" to make vim better to use such as remapping the caps lock key to a better key. Also surprised that you can use shift to write ZZ and ZQ to quit vim without caps lock.

3. [Regular Expressions (Regex) Tutorial: How to Match Any Pattern of Text
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa-TUpSx1JA)<br>
A short tutorial that covers the most important basics about regular expressions.
In the video, the creator used Atom editor to solely focus on regex instead of using
grep or sed which in my opinion is quite good. Examples and real use cases was also given. 

4. [Types of Virtualization](https://jandjtech.com/managed-service/virtualization/seven-different-types-of-virtualization/)<br>
Short and brief article about what is virtualization and then types of virtualization with real life examples included. After searching more turns out the article was written in behalf of an American tech company based in New Mexico called J and J.

5. [thenewboston's Linux Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjuHHI60s44&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGCkg2uj3PxUWhMDuTw3VKjM)<br>
Youtube playlist containing multiple videos that explains linux commands from the basics such as `ls` and `cd` to a more advanced ones such as permissions, users, and groups. I have watched some of the videos included way before I'm taking the OS class. Pretty interesting since he follows real world cases instead of what is available in Linux

6. [Learn Docker in 12 Minutes üê≥](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFl2mCHdv24)<br>
Overly simplified video about how docker works and the things you need to install, and develop to start using docker. Very interesting topic to know that Docker (or containerization in general) is similar to a lightweight VirtualBox. Oh and by the way this was the video that got me started on getting into computer infrastructure.

7. [Never say "If" writing a Bash script! (Exit codes & logical operators)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0KKBmfiVl0)<br>
Best practice example when writing shell scripts. In the video the creator explaiend about exit codes (1 & 0) which usually indicates whether an operation failed or succeeded and also the usage of short circuiting on logical operators such as && and || to avoid using if else statements.

8. [Bash Scripting Tutorial - 3. User Input](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-input.php)<br>
Short tutorial about taking user inputs using bash. Objectively speaking this might not be a very interesting topic but to me it gives me a clear idea about how CLI applications such as git or anything really takes user inputs. In short, you can use `read varname` with varname as the environment variable where the input will be stored at, after that you can use it with anything as a regular string or number, etc.

9. [Virtualization Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZR0rG3HKIk) and the [article](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/hypervisors?utm_medium=OSocial&utm_source=Youtube&utm_content=000005UJ&utm_term=10002434&utm_id=YTDescription-101-Virtualization-Explained-LH-Hypervisors-Guide&cm_mmc=OSocial_Youtube-_-Cloud+and+Data+Platform_Cloud+Platform+F2F-_-WW_WW-_-YTDescription-101-Virtualization-Explained-LH-Hypervisors-Guide&cm_mmca1=000005UJ&cm_mmca2=10002434)<br>
Video that explains about mostly the hypervisor technology in virtualization. The creator explained that using virtual machines is sometimes more reliable than setting up a physical machines due to cost friendliness, performance, available management tools, and also ease of migration when the system goes down you can just move it as if you were to move an application. Other than that, the 2 types of hypervisors were also explained (type 1 and 2).

10. [SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS: What‚Äôs The Difference & How To Choose](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/saas-vs-paas-vs-iaas-whats-the-difference-and-how-to-choose/)<br>
A good summary on the differences between Software vs. Platform vs. Infrastructure as a service, in short the differences are in what you manage and what are managed by the company. Most notable difference that I have experienced myself is Digital Ocean and Heroku where Digital Ocean is literally set your own machine while Heroku already provides a complete interface and also a library on what you want to deploy based on the programming language, etc. In short software is already complete, platform is almost, while infrastructure is a do it yourself.
